**Why am I doing this?**

I am doing this project to showcase the skills I have learnt on this course.

**How did I expect the challenge to go?**

I expected this challenge to be relatively achievable as I have worked diligently on this course, however I did expect to encounter some problems with testing.

**What went well / what didn't go as expected?**

I was successful in completing the challenge of developing an application backend with full CRUD functionality, including several custom queries and a custom exception. I also created successful unit and integration tests, which achieved over 90% coverage. I originally intended to create multiple custom exception but only managed one.

**What possible improvements could be made?**

This project could be improved with more custom exceptions. At present the database holds a table of Customer records, however it could also have a table of Employee records.

**Postman requests and the output from the API:**

Create Customer:

Read Customer By Id:

Read Customer By Name:

Read Customer By Phone:

Update Customer:

Delete Customer:
